## Model Libraries
- [CoMSES Model Library ](https://www.comses.net/codebases/) - Open repository containing models. Developed by CoMSES Net and based on the United States
- [OSF](https://osf.io/) - Open repository containing models, research papers, data sets, software and more. Developed by the Center for Open Science and based on the United States.
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) - Open repository containing models, research papers, data sets, software and more. Developed by CERN and based on Europe.

## Modelling Standards
- [ODD](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.08.019) - The ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol standardize the published descriptions of individual-based and agent-based models (ABMs).

## Societies Discussing Modelling Practices
- [OMF](https://www.openmodelingfoundation.org/) - The Open Modeling Foundation is an alliance of modeling organizations that coordinates and administers a common, community developed body of standards and best practices among diverse communities of modeling scientists.
- [CSDMS](https://csdms.colorado.edu/) - The Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) deals with the Earth's surface, promoting the modeling of earth surface processes by developing, supporting, and disseminating integrated software modules.
- [CoMSES Net](https://www.comses.net/) - The Network for Computational Modeling in the Social and Ecological Sciences (CoMSES Net), is an open community with a goal of improving the way we develop, share, use, and reuse agent based and computational models for the study of social and ecological systems.

## Guides
- [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://carpentries-lab.github.io/good-enough-practices/index.html) - Carpentries's tutorial on good scientific computing practices for researchers.

## Papers
- [Beyond guides, protocols and acronyms: Adoption of good modelling practices depends on challenging academia's status quo in ecology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2024.110829) - Examines why good modeling practices remain underused in ecology despite available guidelines, identifying structural academic barriers and proposing cultural, educational, and institutional changes to promote broader adoption and recognition of reproducible modeling.
- [Cracking the code: Linking good modeling and coding practices for new ecological modelers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2024.110926) - Highlights common coding challenges faced by new ecological modelers, categorizes them across key stages of good modeling practice, and offers guidance to build coding and documentation skills that support reliable, reproducible models.
- [Towards normalizing good practice across the whole modeling cycle: its instrumentation and future research topics](https://doi.org/10.18174/sesmo.18755) - Introduces a Joint Special Issue on Good Modeling Practice, emphasizing the importance of clarifying modeling choices, synthesizing existing work, identifying gaps, and promoting standards and education to make good practices the norm.
